## Introduction

The Google Chrome Dinosaur Game is a simple endless runner game that appears in the browser when there's no internet connection. The goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning agent using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train the dino to avoid obstacles and score as high as possible.

## Features

- Train a DQN to play the Google Chrome Dinosaur Game
- Monitor the agent's performance during training
- Visualize training results and model performance
- Easily customize and tweak hyperparameters for the DQN

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samuelmuniz/DinoDQN.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

## Usage

To start training the DQN agent:

```bash
python train_dino.py
```

## Training

The training process involves the DQN learning to make the right decisions based on the current state of the game. It uses a neural network to predict the best action (e.g., jump or not jump) given the current state.

Adjust the training parameters in `config.py` to experiment with different hyperparameter settings.

## Testing

To test the trained model:

```bash
python test_dino.py --model-path path/to/your/model.pth
```

The agent will play the game using the specified model file.
